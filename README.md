# Sezzle Calc


This project was a coding challenge given to me by Sezzle. It's a calculator that allows multiple users to remotely make basic calculations and display the results for anyone else connected to see. It can be thought of as a WebSocket-based chat React app where the only form of communication is math operations.

## Specifications

The main specifications were that 1. multiple users could add calculations at once and 2. see them added in real time. In addition to this, 3. only the last 10 results should be displayed (from newest to oldest) at once and 4. the calculations must remain between sessions.
